The "files" directory

This directory is used to hold dynamic content created by the system.
It MUST be writable by the web server process. For example, if your
web server runs as "apache", then the "files" directory must be
writable by "apache." If your webserver runs as "www," then "files"
must be writable by "www." All dynamically-generated content will
end up in this directory; this includes:

. uploaded files
. compiled templates
. generated XML components

As a worst-case scenario, you can make the directory writable by
world (everyone) like this (under Unix/Linux):

chmod -R go+w files/

This is a bad idea, because malicious users on your system could
then place their own content in the files directory, replacing your
site's content.
